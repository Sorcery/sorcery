## 0.8.6

* `current_user` returns `nil` instead of `false` if there's no user loggd in (#493)
* MongoMapper adapter does not override `save!` method anymore. However due to ORM's lack of support for `validate: false` in `save!`, the combination of `validate: false` and `raise_on_failure: true` is not possible in MongoMapper. The errors will not be raised in this situation. (#151)
* Fixed rename warnings for bcrypt-ruby
* The way Sorcery adapters are included has been changed due to problem with multiple `included` blocks error in `ActiveSupport::Concern` class (#527)

* Make send_email_* methods easier to overwrite (#473)
* Don't add `:username` field for User. Config option `username_attribute_names` is now `:email` by default instead of `:username`.

  If you're using `username` as main field for users to login, you'll need to tune your Sorcery config:

    ```ruby
    config.user_config do |user|
      # ...
      user.username_attribute_names = [:username]
    end
    ```
* `rails generate sorcery:install` now works inside Rails engine

## 0.8.4

* Few security fixes in `external` module

## 0.8.3 (yanked because of bad Jeweler release)

## 0.8.2

* Activity logging feature has a new column called `last_login_from_ip_address` (string type). If you use ActiveRecord, you will have to add this column to DB ([#465](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/issues/465))
