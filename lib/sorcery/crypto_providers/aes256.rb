    # This encryption method is reversible if you have the supplied key.
    # So in order to use this encryption method you must supply it with a key first.
    # In an initializer, or before your application initializes, you should do the following:
    #
    #   Sorcery::Model::ConfigAES256.key = "my 32 bytes long key"
    #
    # My final comment is that this is a strong encryption method,
    # but its main weakness is that its reversible. If you do not need to reverse the hash
    # then you should consider Sha512 or BCrypt instead.
    #
    # Keep your key in a safe place, some even say the key should be stored on a separate server.
    # This won't hurt performance because the only time it will try and access the key on the
    # separate server is during initialization, which only
    # happens once. The reasoning behind this is if someone does compromise your server they
    # won't have the key also. Basically, you don't want to store the key with the lock.
